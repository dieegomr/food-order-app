<p>
This is a food order application where it has a list of meals from which user can choose and he can then add these meals to the cart and later manage the cart adding more dishes or changing the quantity.</p>
<p>Food order app is part of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101Way3@Tl-LkQQtUAOqtTxMOnWfVxtvmAXWum0zMXkgJeQeEA3ZxE_NFZ1NpKMcjaQF9vuqrQ==/">"React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
"</a>.</p>
<p>It was possible to practice components, React Hooks, render lists and conditional content, fetch data via Http(I have used Firebase as a back end), loading state, read form values, form validation and more.

<p>
The HTML and CSS were ready, but it was necessary to implement the JSX code for the site to work properly. </p>
